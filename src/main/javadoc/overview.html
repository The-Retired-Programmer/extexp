        <p>A plugin for Netbeans to define a project type to create file(s) using a
            series of text merges, transformations and substitutions.</p>
        <p>It runs a user definable pipeline of actions, controlled by parameters,
            communicating between actions with files in the standard filesystem, or a
            memory based file system.</p>
        <p>Currently actions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Markdown processing (markdown to html fragments)</li>
        
            <li>Substitute/Merge (insertion of file content or parameter strings into a
                template file)</li>
        
            <li>Freemarker template language processing</li>
        
            <li>XSLT processing (xml to xml as directed by an xslt stylesheet)</li>
        
            <li>FOP processing (fo-xsl to pdf)</li>
        
            <li>Creation of an html img tag suitable for use in a reactive modelled html page
                (using a srcset attribute)</li>
        
            <li>Ability to run any OS utility program</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typical use cases are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creation of pdf documents (books/reports etc) from markdown sources</li>
            <li>Creation of web sites, consisting of a set of static web pages, built from
                various sources (markdown , html templates, html fragments, parameters)</li>
        </ul>
