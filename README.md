# ExTexP Plugin #

**Extendable Text Processor**

A plugin for Netbeans to create a new project type to create file(s) using a series
of text merges, transformations and subtitutions.

Currently actions include:

*   Markdown processing (markdown -> html fragments)
*   Substitute/Merge (insertion of file content or parameter strings into a
template file)
*   XSLT processing (xml -> xml as directed by an xslt stylesheet)
*   FOP processing (fo-xsl -> pdf)
*   Creation of an html img tag suitable for use in a reactive modelled html page
(using a srcset attribute)

Typical use cases are:

*   Creation of pdf documents (books/reports etc) from markdown sources
*   Creation of web sites, consisting of a set of static web pages, built from various
sources (markdown , html templates, html fragments, parameters)
